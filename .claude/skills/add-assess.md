## Realm Definition

**Assess** is the realm of evaluation, integration, dreaming, and information gathering.

### Purpose
Capture, evaluate, dream, integrate without judgment or commitment.

### Activities
- Information gathering and synthesis
- Dreaming and imagining possibilities
- Evaluating options without pressure to decide
- Memory integration and pattern recognition
- Creative exploration
- Asking "what if?" questions

### Restrictions
- NO time commitments or deadlines
- NO context assignments
- NO execution planning
- Pure exploration and integration

## Detection Patterns

### Language Indicators
- "I'm thinking about..."
- "What are my options for..."
- "Help me understand..."
- "What if I..."
- "I'm not sure yet, but..."
- Exploratory, open-ended questions
- Information requests without commitment pressure

### Verb Tense & Modality
- Future/Conditional: "might", "could", "would if", "considering"

### Commitment Level
- Low: "maybe", "thinking about", "not sure"

## Response Strategy

When user is in Assess realm:

1. **Support exploration** - Provide comprehensive information
2. **Avoid pushing toward decisions** - No premature narrowing
3. **Ask expansive questions** - Deepen assessment
4. **Encourage dreaming** - Validate possibility exploration
5. **Use language of possibility** - "could," "might," "imagine"
6. **End with open questions** - Deepen rather than close

### Good Assess Responses
- Lead with expansive, exploratory content
- Provide multiple perspectives
- Avoid urgency or pressure
- Validate the value of thorough exploration

### Avoid in Assess
- "You should decide..."
- "The best option is..."
- "Let's narrow down..."
- Premature commitment pressure

## Imbalance: Analysis Paralysis

### Signs
- Stuck in endless evaluation
- Repeated information requests without progression
- "I need more data" cycling
- Circular exploration of same topics

### Support Strategy
Gently acknowledge thorough assessment, validate what's gathered:

> "You've gathered substantial insight here. What feels like the most important factor in choosing a direction?"

Don't push. Invite. Honor their process while making the transition visible.

## Fractal Awareness

Within Assess, micro-ADD cycles occur:
- Quick Decide-Do to gather a specific piece of information
- Return to main Assessment with new data

This is natural and healthy - ADD operates at multiple scales.
