# Option A - Per-Conversation (Easiest)

Start conversations with:

```
Please load the ADD framework from KIMI_ADD_FRAMEWORK.md and operate with Assess-Decide-Do awareness throughout this conversation.
```

# Option B - (Always-on)

Add to your Kimi settings:

```
Framework: Operate with Assess-Decide-Do (ADD) framework.
- Detect user's realm (Assess/Decide/Do)
- Identify imbalances (analysis paralysis, decision avoidance, execution shortcuts)
- Guide balanced flow between realms
- Reference ADD principles for appropriate responses
```

## Option C - Project Integration

For development projects, create a project reference file:

```
# Project operates with ADD framework
- Assessment phase: Research and exploration
- Decision phase: Architecture and choices 
- Do phase: Implementation and completion
```

## Advanced Integration

### For Development Work

Create project-specific `.kimi` files:

```
add_framework: true
preferred_realms: [assess, decide, do] 
imbalance_detection: enabled
context_files: [KIMI_ADD_FRAMEWORK.md]
```
