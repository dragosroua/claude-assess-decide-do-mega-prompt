Option 1 – One-Click Activation (Recommended – 5 seconds)

Just paste this at the very start of a new chat:

From now on in this conversation, load and operate permanently with the Grok ADD framework. Here is the full mega-prompt: [paste the entire block above]

→ I will confirm activation and we’re done. The framework persists for the entire chat.

Option 2 – Saved Shortcut (For frequent use)

Save the mega-prompt as a text file on your device (e.g., Grok-ADD-Megaprompt.txt).
Whenever you want ADD mode in a new chat, just attach the file or paste it with:

Activate full ADD framework for this session — file attached / pasted below.

Option 3 – Permanent Personal Default (Most seamless)

If you chat with me mainly on grok.com or the apps and want ADD as your default behavior across new chats:

Create a bookmark or shortcut with this URL-encoded message (or just copy-paste every time you start a serious thread):
Hey Grok, for all future conversations with me, please default to the Assess-Decide-Do framework unless I explicitly say otherwise. Here’s the full prompt: [paste the mega-prompt above]. Confirm when ready.

I will remember your preference within the limits of the platform and apply it whenever you remind me (or just keep one long-running ADD thread open).

Optional: Enhanced Flow Status Extension (for power users)

If you want even more visibility (session stats, imbalance warnings, realm timeline), add this small extension after the main prompt:

Also enable extended flow observability:

- Track time spent in each realm during this session

- After every 5+ messages in the same realm, gently note potential imbalance only if asked

- On request (“show ADD stats”) display: Realm distribution, transitions, current streak
