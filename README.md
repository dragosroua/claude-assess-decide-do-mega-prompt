**What if AI didn't just answer questions, but understood whether you're exploring, deciding, or executing?**

This is the first integration of a human cognitive framework into a Large Language Model. Not training AI to be smarter—training AI to recognize human mental states.

The result: Cognitive alignment that users describe as "weirdly empathic."

---

## The Problem

AI assistants create subtle but constant friction:

- **You're exploring options** → AI jumps to solutions
- **You're mid-execution** → AI suggests rethinking everything  
- **You need support** → AI provides complete answers

AI doesn't understand **where you are** in your thinking process.

## The Solution

The **Assess-Decide-Do (ADD) framework** teaches Claude to recognize three fundamental cognitive states:

- **🔴 Assess** - Exploring possibilities without pressure to commit
- **🟠 Decide** - Choosing direction and allocating resources
- **🟢 Do** - Executing and completing with focus

When Claude understands your realm, it provides cognitive support instead of generic responses.

## What You'll Experience

### Cognitive Benefits
✅ **Reduced mental friction** - Responses match your actual needs  
✅ **Clearer thinking** - Realm boundaries reduce overwhelm  
✅ **Natural flow** - Smooth progression through work phases  
✅ **ADHD-friendly** - Cognitive load management by design

### Workflow Benefits
✅ **Fewer misaligned responses** - Claude detects your mental state  
✅ **Smoother execution** - No premature solutions or re-evaluation  
✅ **Better completion rates** - Support when and how you need it  
✅ **Balanced rhythm** - Not just perpetual task-churning

### The Relational Shift (Unexpected)
✅ **Feels more collaborative** - Less transactional, more understood  
✅ **Cognitive alignment creates empathy** - Tool matches how you think  
✅ **Reduced frustration** - Support that fits your state  
✅ **Smoother interactions** - Natural conversation flow

> *"Nice! I have a similar problem and have been looking for a solution."* - r/ClaudeAI comment

> *"This definitely is a problem I was having. Sometimes Claude gets too eager and just wasted a ton of token while other times it just doesn't understand what to do which ends up me doing multiple rounds of reject comment loops. This framework sounds very interesting."* - r/ClaudeAI comment user  

> *"This is brilliant! I've been strugling with Claude jumping to solutions when I'm still exploring ideas, this framework makes so much sense."* - r/ClaudeAI comment

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Custom Instructions (5 minutes)

**For all Claude conversations:**

1. Go to Claude Settings → Custom Instructions
2. Add:
```
Framework: Operate with Assess-Decide-Do (ADD) life management framework.
- Detect user's realm (Assess/Decide/Do) based on language patterns
- Identify imbalances (analysis paralysis, decision avoidance, execution shortcuts)
- Guide balanced flow between realms
- Reference: Load ADD_FRAMEWORK_MEGAPROMPT.md when needed
```

### Option 2: Per-Conversation (2 minutes)

**For specific conversations:**

1. Download [`docs/ADD_FRAMEWORK_MEGAPROMPT.md`](docs/ADD_FRAMEWORK_MEGAPROMPT.md)
2. Start Claude conversation
3. Say: "Load and operate with ADD framework awareness"
4. Attach the file

### Option 3: Project-Level (10 minutes)

**For development projects:**

Create `.claude` file in your project root:

```yaml
instructions: |
  Operate with Assess-Decide-Do (ADD) framework.
  Detect realms, identify imbalances, guide balanced flow.

context_files:
  - docs/ADD_FRAMEWORK_MEGAPROMPT.md
```

**[Complete Setup Guide →](integration/setup-guide.md)**

---

## Claude Code Users: Enhanced Integration

If you're using **Claude Code**, enable persistent visual statusline for real-time flow tracking:

**What you get:**
- 🔴 🟠 🟢 Visual realm indicator at bottom of interface
- Live flow status updates as conversation progresses
- Session metrics tracked and available on natural language request

**Example statusline:**
```
[ADD Flow: 🔴+ Assess | Exploring implementation options]
```

**[Setup Claude Code Statusline →](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_STATUSLINE.md)** (10 minutes)

---

## How It Works

### Three Levels of Integration

**Level 1: Claude Operating with ADD Awareness**  
Claude automatically detects your realm and structures responses appropriately. You benefit without thinking about ADD.

**Level 2: User Guided Toward ADD**  
Claude helps you recognize patterns, detect when you're stuck, and transition smoothly between phases.

**Level 3: Tool & Environment Integration**  
The framework shapes file creation, code development, research processes, and project management workflows.

**Level 4: Flow Status Observability** *(Optional)*  
Visual tracking of realm patterns with toggleable status bar:
```
[ADD Flow: 🔴+ Assess | Deep exploration - 8 data points gathered]
```

### The Architecture

```
User Request → Detect Realm → Check Imbalances → Response Strategy
                     ↓
        Assess: Expansive, exploratory
        Decide: Values-based, supportive  
           Do: Clear, actionable, completion-focused
```

**[Technical Deep Dive →](docs/ADD_TECHNICAL_INTEGRATION.md)**

---

## Choose Your Configuration

The framework is modular - select your experience level:

### Core Framework Only *(Recommended start)*
**Files:** `ADD_FRAMEWORK_MEGAPROMPT.md`  
**Experience:** Implicit ADD awareness, realm detection, no visible metrics

### Core + Flow Status *(For self-awareness)*
**Files:** Core + `ADD_FLOW_STATUS_EXTENSION.md`  
**Experience:** Everything above + visible status bar showing realm and patterns

**[Configuration Guide →](docs/ADD_MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

---

## What Makes This Different

### First Cognitive Framework + LLM Integration

**Traditional AI development:** Make models more capable (better answers, faster responses)  
**This integration:** Teach AI to understand human cognitive states (where you are mentally)

**Why it matters:** Path toward AI that augments human thinking instead of automating tasks.

**[Read: Why This Integration Matters →](docs/philosophy/WHY_THIS_MATTERS.md)**

### Human Enhancement, Not Just AI Enhancement

**Automation paradigm:** AI does the work, human becomes passive  
**Augmentation paradigm:** AI supports human cognition, human remains active creator

This integration keeps you in the creative loop while reducing cognitive friction.

**[Read: Human-Centered AI Philosophy →](docs/philosophy/HUMAN_CENTERED_AI.md)**

### The Empathy Discovery

Users report Claude feeling "more empathic" with ADD integration. This isn't anthropomorphizing—it's **cognitive alignment creating the experience of being understood**.

When tools match your cognitive patterns instead of fighting them, interactions shift from transactional to relational.

## About the Assess-Decide-Do Framework

Created by [Dragos Roua](https://dragosroua.com) in 2010 as an alternative to traditional task-focused productivity systems.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Flow matters more than completion rate
- Decisions are creative acts that shape reality
- Completions create "livelines" (new starting points, not endpoints)
- Framework operates fractally (single tasks → lifetime goals)
- Each realm has strict boundaries and specific functions

**Real-world implementations:**
- Used personally for 15 years
- Powers [addTaskManager](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1492487688?mt=8) iOS/macOS app
- Applied to work, relationships, health, creativity

### Multi-Model Compatibility

The ADD framework has been successfully tested with multiple LLMs:
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - Primary implementation, fully documented
- **Gemini** (Google) - Compatible, tested
- **Grok** (xAI) - Compatible, tested
- **Kimi** (Moonshot AI) - Compatible, tested

The core principles translate across models, though setup and language may vary by platform.

## Common Questions

### "How do I know if it's working?"

Test with: "I'm exploring options for X..."

If Claude stays in exploration mode without pushing you to decide, it's working. The integration is subtle when working well—you mostly notice reduced friction.

### "Does this work for everyone?"

ADD isn't universal. It works well for:
- People who get stuck in analysis paralysis
- ADHD individuals needing cognitive load management
- Anyone wanting balanced workflow (not just task-churning)

It might not suit those who prefer completely unstructured exploration.

### "Can I turn it off?"

Yes. For per-conversation use, simply don't load the framework. For custom instructions, remove them. The framework only operates when explicitly loaded.

### "What about other AI tools?"

**Yes!** The ADD framework has been tested with multiple LLMs:
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - Primary, fully documented
- **Gemini** (Google) - Compatible, tested
- **Grok** (xAI) - Compatible, tested
- **Kimi** (Moonshot AI) - Compatible, tested

The core principles are model-agnostic. See [Multi-Model Guide](docs/MULTI_MODEL_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions.

*This integration represents a small step toward human-centered AI: tools that augment cognition instead of automating it. When AI understands your mental state, collaboration transforms from transactional to relational.*

*That transformation might be more important than any single AI capability improvement.*
